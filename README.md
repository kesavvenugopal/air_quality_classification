# air_quality_classification
An ML project that classifies the Air Quality based on parameters like pollutants concentration, population density, distance from industrial location etc.

-> The dataset used for the project is also provided
-> There are 2 project files:
1. The ipynb file is the full project. Please refer this for the step by step ML project.
2. The .py file is a compact, final build model that does only the classification from the user inputs. So please refer to the Jupyter file if any confusion arises.

-> The built model has been pickled. If anyone wants to use the model for their own tests, feel free to use them.
ty!
