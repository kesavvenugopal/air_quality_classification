# **Air Quality Classification - Machine Learning Project**  

This project aims to classify **Air Quality** based on various parameters such as:  
✅ Pollutant concentration  
✅ Population density  
✅ Distance from industrial locations  
... and more.

## **📂 Project Files**  
- **`AirQualityClassification.ipynb`** – A Jupyter Notebook containing the **full step-by-step implementation** of the project, including **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights**.  
- **`AirQualityClassifier.py`** – A **compact Python script** for classification. This is the final build that takes user input and returns predictions. If any confusion arises, refer to the Jupyter file.  
- **`rf_model.pkl`** – The trained and pickled **machine learning model**, which can be reused for classification tasks.  

## **🗂 Dataset**  
The dataset used for this project is **provided** within the repository. It contains air quality parameters, pollution levels, and relevant environmental factors.  

## **⚡ How to Use the Model**  
1️⃣ Load the pickled model (`rf_model.pkl`).  
2️⃣ Provide user input (pollutant levels, population density, etc.).  
3️⃣ Get the predicted **Air Quality classification**.  

Feel free to use the model for your own tests! 🎯
